### Make sure you are in the root directory...
1. Read the `docker-compose.yml` file and change any ports that you need to based on your local setup
2. Run `docker-compose up`
3. Open the project inside intellij
4. Go to the `application.properties` file and follow the instructions to make your dev profile.
5. look over the code base and familiarize yourself with [spring boot docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/). 
3. Run the `BackendApplication`
4. Visit `http://localhost:8080/` or localhost at a port you chose if you changed any ports in the `application-dev.properties` file.
